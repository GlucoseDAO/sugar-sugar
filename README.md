# sugar-sugar
Game to predict glucose values

This game is designed to test and improve users' ability to visually predict glucose values. Players are presented with glucose data and challenged to predict future values based on visual patterns. The game helps users understand how accurate their intuitive predictions are compared to actual glucose measurements, providing a fun way to develop pattern recognition skills in glucose data analysis.

> ðŸŽµ Fun fact: The name "sugar-sugar" was inspired by a scientific remake of The Archies' classic hit song ["Sugar, Sugar"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJvAL-iiLnQ) from 1969!
